@article{Love2014,
abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html webcite.},

@article{Huber2003,
abstract = {We derive and validate an estimator for the parameters of a transformation for the joint calibration (normalization) and variance stabilization of microarray intensity data. With this, the variances of the transformed intensities become approximately independent of their expected values. The transformation is similar to the logarithm in the high intensity range, but has a smaller slope for intensities close to zero. Applications have shown better sensitivity and specificity for the detection of differentially expressed genes. In this paper, we describe the theoretical aspects of the method. We incorporate calibration and variance-mean dependence into a statistical model and use a robust variant of the maximum-likelihood method to estimate the transformation parameters. Using simulations, we investigate the size of the estimation error and its dependence on sample size and the presence of outliers. We find that the error decreases with the square root of the number of probes per array and that the estimation is robust against the presence of differentially expressed genes. Software is publicly available as an R package through the Bioconductor project (http://www.bioconductor.org).},

@article{Tibshirani1988,
abstract = {I propose a method for the nonparametric estimation of transformations for regression. It is much more flexible than the familiar Box-Cox procedure, allowing general smooth transformations of the variables, and is similar to the ACE (alternating conditional expectation) algorithm of Breiman and Friedman (1985). The ACE procedure uses scatterplot smoothers in an iterative fashion to find the maximally correlated transformations of the variables. Like ACE, my proposal can incorporate continuous, categorical, or periodic variables, or any mixture of these types. The method differs from ACE in that it uses a (nonparametric) variance-stabilizing transformation for the response variable. The technique seems to alleviate many of the anomalies that ACE suffers with regression data, including the inability to reproduce model transformations and sensitivity to the marginal distribution of the predictors. I provide several examples, including an analysis of the "brain and body weight" data and some data on telephone-call load. I also discuss the relationship of the proposed technique to the Box-Cox and ACE procedures. Efron's work on transformations provides some of the theoretical basis for the methodology.},

@article{Anders2010,
abstract = {High-throughput sequencing assays such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq or barcode counting provide quantitative readouts in the form of count data. To infer differential signal in such data correctly and with good statistical power, estimation of data variability throughout the dynamic range and a suitable error model are required. We propose a method based on the negative binomial distribution, with variance and mean linked by local regression and present an implementation, DESeq, as an R/Bioconductor package.},
